This was my initial attempt to built my pokemon quiz app when I was learning React with class-based components.

My code has since improved, and I rebuilt this using hooks and properly thinking about where all the code should sit. You can find that [here] (https://github.com/justjooshing/CRA-hooks-pokemon-quiz)
